# SCIAC-scouting


Scouting site for SCIAC baseball. This site was built using the Django framework in Python. A login page brings the user to the home page which displays the 2018 team stats for SCIAC baseball. From there, each team has their own stats page with all thier players. Finally, each player has their own scouting report page. These scouting reports include a write up (except for Pomona-Pitzer players), spraycharts for the hitters, and video for those that I could find.
